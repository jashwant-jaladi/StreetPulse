            "question":"I received an email from StreetPulse.com regarding an order I didn’t place. What should I do?",
            "answer":"If you received correspondence regarding an order you didn’t place, it likely wasn’t from StreetPulse.com. Don't share any personal information, click any links in the email, or respond to the email, and delete it immediately. This type of email is known as a phishing campaign. A phishing campaign is an email scam designed to steal personal information from victims. Cybercriminals use phishing, the fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information such as credit card details and login credentials, by disguising themselves as a trustworthy organization or reputable person in an email communication.If you are a StreetPulse.com customer, you can go to your StreetPulse Account and view Your Order History to see if there is an order that matches the details in the correspondence. If you are not a StreetPulse.com customer, feel free to contact us to verify whether the email is associated with an actual order."

StreetPulse will never send communications from personal or generic email accounts. Order-related emails typically come from cs-noreply@StreetPulse.com or another StreetPulse.com email address."

            "question":"What should I do if I believe I’ve received a phishing email or if I responded to what may be a phishing email?",
            "answer":"If you believe you received a phishing email or responded to what may be a phishing email, StreetPulse recommends you update your online passwords, including the password to your StreetPulse.com Account, and report the email to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

            "question":"Can I pay with multiple Visa, Mastercard, American Express, or Discover Pre-Paid Gift Cards?",
            "answer":"Any pre-paid gift card with a Visa, Mastercard, American Express, or Discover logo / insignia on it will be processed like an actual credit / debit card and only one credit card can be used per order. If a single pre-gift card does not cover the total of your order, we suggest using the balance on the pre-paid gift card to purchase a StreetPulse Gift Certificate. The StreetPulse Gift Certificate can then be used along with a credit card or pre-paid gift card to complete the order. If you have multiple pre-paid gift cards, you will need to purchase a separate StreetPulse Gift Certificate for each. If you need any help with purchasing the StreetPulse Gift Certificates or placing an order, please give our Customer Loyalty Team a call, and we will be happy to help! Please also note that in order to use the pre-paid gift card on StreetPulse, it will need to be registered or activated by following the instructions on the pre-paid gift card itself or on the card’s packaging. Also, some card may not be eligible for online purchases. Please refer to the company that issued the card for more details."

            "answer":"Amazon Pay is a service that allows Amazon customers to use the payment information already stored in their Amazon account to pay for goods and services on other sites. You can use Amazon Pay wherever you see it - whether that is clicking the Amazon Pay button when checking out on your favorite online stores, managing your payment methods in your account on Amazon.com or using Amazon Pay on Alexa.

            "answer":"If you have an Amazon account, you are ready to start using Amazon Pay wherever you see the Amazon Pay button. No additional registration is necessary, which means you don’t need to create a new account or remember old passwords. Amazon Pay simply uses the information and payment methods stored in your Amazon account. That also includes your address book, so you’ll always have Grandmom’s address handy no matter where you shop."
