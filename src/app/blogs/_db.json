        "content":"When Pharrell Williams isn’t busy helming the next collection for Louis Vuitton, the fashion and music entrepreneur has been giving advice to Nigo’s HUMAN MADE. At a preview appointment for the Paris-based Kenzo, where Nigo serves as the artistic director, he revealed to WWD that Williams recently earned an official role at his own company. Nigo is most well-known for being the founding of A Bathing Ape (BAPE), though he ultimately departed from the brand in 2013. A few years prior to leaving BAPE, he created his own lifestyle brand, HUMAN MADE. As Nigo and Williams have been collaborators for decades – and co-founded Billionaire Boys Club, and its sub-label ICECREAM together – it was only fitting that the musical artist would continue to work alongside Nigo at HUMAN MADE. “He didn’t have an official role and I thought it was time to make it official that he’s actually advising on the direction of the brand,” Nigo told WWD.“I’ve really just started talking about it with Pharrell now in this position, and Brian Donnelly [aka Kaws] is also an adviser,” he continued. “So now the three of us are officially going to have this responsibility and we’re going to start working out plans.” Nigo has previously revealed that Williams was an advisor to HUMAN MADE on Instagram, sharing an image of the two of them together alongside matching rings, but hadn’t elaborated on the nature of his role."

        "title":"The Difference between Fashion and Style",
        "content":"Fashion is temporary and it fades with time and season. Style has a permanent nature or it reflects one's taste and personality. Fashion means to cream something and style means to designs something which is already created. People use the word style and fashion interchangeably but that is wrong. Both the words have different meanings. Fashion is a popular style in clothing,Guest Posting footwear, makeup. It is the new collection created by designers. What you see in a magazine and on fashion runway that is fashion. A fashionable person wears the latest fashion. Whereas style is timeless. It changes when a person changes his own style or want to redefine style. Whether you like fashionable items or stylish clothes you can get them stitched by booking tailor service at home. Here is a quote to understand the difference between fashion and style “Style is very personal. It has nothing to do with fashion. Fashion is over quickly. The style is forever.” Fashion is an art which is quite difficult to keep pace with as trends change with every season. Our style is influenced my many long lasting factors .for e.g. it is impacted by political behavior, religious beliefs, culture, weather, body type, professional environment and family upbringing. Fashion can be compared with dishes that are presented in hotels and restaurant. In hotel, even a simple dish is present with lots of creativity, innovation, and expertise just like models that walk the runway wearing big brand designer’s clothes. Women everyday wear a replica of those dresses and still look fashionable but not as the model on the runway. It is unique to them and it is special. Fashion Is Related To External Fashion is about what is prevailing out in the fashion industry. What are people wearing most of the time to what you are wearing? For example, the off shoulder was in fashion last year and if you followed that trend you wore something fashionable but if you were not wearing off shoulders and stuck to your basic white tee then that’s your style. Style Is Related To Internal The style is about what you wear. What you like to wear or what kind of clothes make you feel good. When you follow your style you don’t care about what is prevailing in the fashion industry or what people are wearing this season. You wear clothes which help you reflect your personal style. Fashion Is Distracting and Style Is Connecting Fashion can distract our attention from ourselves and style helps in bringing attention to ourselves. For example, fashion changes with every season and year, so if we focus on fashion we will be wearing what everybody will be wearing without giving a second thought about what suits our taste and body. But if we focus on the style we will be wearing things which suits are mood and personality, we will wear clothes which will help to showcase our personality. How Can We Relate Style And Trend? Style and fashion should never be confused.  You can look both stylish and fashionable at the same time. Also, there is no compulsion to follow fashion. You can look great without the following fashion. To look great you just need to stick to basic eternal clothing pieces. Like the basic tee, blue denim, But if you like following trends don’t follow them blindly, add a flavor or your own twist to prevailing trends and you are good to go. When you follow a trend blindly it ends up making you look crappy. Therefore first learn how to look stylish and then follow trends. A quote be Mary Ellen “I think it’s all about truly, truly knowing yourself, loving yourself, loving yourself not just modifying, covering flaws.etc –but loving yourself exactly the way you are right now- and dressing to honor that.“"
